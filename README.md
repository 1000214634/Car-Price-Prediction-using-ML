# Car-Price-Prediction-using-ML

The project "Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning" aims to develop a model that can accurately predict the prices of cars based on various input features and machine learning techniques. The objective is to create a predictive model that can assist buyers and sellers in estimating the value of cars.

Here's a summary of the project steps and components:

Data Collection: Collect a dataset that includes information about different cars and their corresponding prices. This data can be obtained from various sources such as car dealerships, online marketplaces, or publicly available datasets.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure its quality and suitability for training a machine learning model. This step involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming the data into a suitable format. It may also involve encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.

Feature Selection: Identify relevant features or input variables that can significantly impact the car's price. These features may include the car's make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine size, number of previous owners, location, and other relevant factors. Feature selection techniques help in choosing the most informative and significant variables.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the prediction task. Commonly used algorithms for regression tasks, such as predicting car prices, include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM. The choice of algorithm depends on factors like dataset size, complexity, and desired accuracy.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Use the training set to train the machine learning model on the selected algorithm. The model learns the relationship between the input features and the target variable (car price) during this phase. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize prediction errors.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using the testing set. Metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute error (MAE) can be used to assess the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.
